## My process

This was a more difficult project to complete. While the layout was rather easy to complete, making the image active and putting an overlay image and background color was more difficult and required looking on Slack for help. While I tried to use CSS to get the image overlay to work, it turned out I needed to use a link tag and create seperate divs for each image and then changing the opacity to toggle the background/foreground image and color.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
-

### What I learned

I learned how to overlay an image with a background that had an opacity of .5 over an existing image.
